RELEASE NOTES
=============

This section lists the system requirements, new features and bug fixes,
as well as known issues associated with this release.

1. System Requirements

   This release of the Virtex-4 Embedded MAC Wrapper is an update
   to be compatible with ISE 9.2i.  It is fully tested on the new
   software version.  Please see the release notes for the 9.2i IP
   Update for full Platform Support and System Requirements.

2. What's new

   The IDELAY component is used in GMII and RGMII PHY standards 
   to meet setup and hold timing.  This delay element is now on 
   both the clock as well as the data pins.  This allows the 
   customer to delay either the clock or the   data to meet setup
   and hold timing.  In the example design, the clock has been 
   delayed to prevent added jitter that comes about from delaying
   the data pins (see XAPP707).  The constraints for setup and hold
   timing have been updated to ensure compliance with the appropriate 
   specifications.  Please see the Getting Started Guide for more 
   information on these constraints.

3. Bugs fixed

   The IDELAY was added to the clock, and the data is no longer delayed
   to ensure no extra jitter is added to the input path.

4. Known Issues

   Embedded MAC Wrapper v4.5, please refer to Answer Record 25222:
