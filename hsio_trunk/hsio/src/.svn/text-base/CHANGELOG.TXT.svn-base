 9/05/14 (434a) reworked trigger top layer and more:
                 - no more OC_RAWCOM (0x101)
                 - temporary removal triggered = pattern go option

12/03/14 (433c) Fixed cyclic bug in sequencer
10/03/14 (433a) 65MHz BCO capable!! Took >30m to build, so just a proof of principle for when we need it
10/03/14 (4339) 50MHz BCO capable. Stable clock switching in place - see reg 0.
                Some LEMOs remapped: 1= Busy out, 2 = BCO out, 3=BCO in, 4=Trig in
                More DCM status bits in statword 15.
 6/03/14 (4332) External clock on LEMOs added - can select either Clocky via P2, or LEMO.

 6/12/13 (431c) increased capture len to 10b = max 6 packets = 60kb = 7.6kB

 5/12/13 (431a) Added capture_start on SCAN_EN
29/11/13 (4313) smarter header-trailer det - looks for 01 head and 0 trail -

27/11/13 (430f) reverted to old tx_packet_format an tried a new ddr block for HSIO-A13
26/11/13 (430e) trying to fix HSIO-A13 - failed
24/11/13 (430d) Atlys single-chip version: Fixed channel stream assignments to match driver:

19/09/13 (41ea) changed rx_packet_decoder to comply better with LL on the input
					 -- look out for CHOMPs!!
18/09/13 (41e9) HSIO-A13, 1T A13
17/09/13 (41e8) HSIO-A13 only - now only stores source MAC when ethtype=0x876X -

26/07/13 (41cd) same as 41cc, but with the muxed signals driving the HSIO-A13 - more realistic

                fixed ext trigger bugs (>1!) - reworked ext trig edge detector, added more sync. Slight mod to 
                status readback - might fix missing words bug. 
27/03/13 (4194) 16 top, 16 bot (incl. histo) NO IDC with added stream output debugs on P3
26/03/13 (4192) 16 top, 16 bot (incl. histo) NO IDC

                Only 1 data stream per ABC130 Module. Raw and capture modes. data gen works too, 
                but needs enable via bit 5 in CONTROL reg
29/11/12 (413b) fixed hysteresis code typo, added RAWCOM pattern go (which may not really work)
12/11/12 (4136) Added programmable busy_delta hi and low levels (aka hysterisis) - see reg 17
                Tidyied readout_top and ro_unit a little
 9/11/12 (4135) changed structure to allow histos to be built without rawfifo option
 2/11/12 (4132) busy bugfix
 1/11/12 (4131) updated trig_decoder to skip over BCC headers - no more spurios trigger counts??

22/08/12 (4121) Added timestamp for make builds 
22/08/12 (4120) Moved pullups to top level - ISE gets confused otherwise

                In general HSIO is less likeky to hang-up. Stavelet build.
17/08/12 (4119) re-added the P2 Aux(12) TWOWIRE port(!) + 3 more (13,14,15)
16/08/12 (4118) re-build with makefile

 3/08/12 (4108) fixed oc_dtack bug - tristates again - seems Z=1 - so now we have oc_dack_n
 3/08/12 (4104) re-added all m_powers (only ones used - all the better for bug spotting) 
                as pkg didn't work
 2/08/12 (4102) removed all m_powers - doing from pkg....
 1/08/12 (4101) converted t_llsrc. ise just doesn't do well with tristates
31/07/12 (4100) converted all ll to t_llbus. 
                Removed all set to zero if not in build generates
30/07/12 (40ff) Reworked oc_dtack line to be bussed (pseudo open-collector, 
                even more pseud as XST makes a wide-as-needed OR gate 
                which is what I wanted in the first place)
25/07/12 (40fe) OCSEQ fix - no more gaps - 16TH+8PH
23/07/12 (40fd) Build with Bruces proc DDR pins now attached - 16TH+8PH
23/07/12 (40fc) Another CRC config error fix (not as much hope as before) - 16TH+8PH
23/07/12 (40fb) CRC config error fix - HOPEFULLY. Added Bruces proc wrapper.
18/07/12 (40fa) working TWOWIRE, but no streams (£$%^& CRC says NO on conf problem is back).
17/07/12 (40f9) changed SHT case handling - just might fix weird bug.
                Added wdog_clr for each word.
17/07/12 (40f8) increased bad OC timeout to ~1s to be MUCH longer than serial timeout

16/07/12 (40f5) (re)added invalid opcode watchdog, fixed unassigned busys
13/07/12 (40f4) (16TH, 8IH) mode40, robuster header-det, more reset options (netrx/tx),
                re-added net statwords. fixed TX data MAC address, now not 0x0000. All untested.
 5/07/12 (40ea) (16TH, 8IH) Display fixed and TWOWIRE now supports SHT and I2C. See twiki.
25/06/12 (40d8) Work on fixing display. Note slow_ticks_gen.vhd move from utils lib to hsio 
                to allow use of pkg_hsio_globals.vhd
22/06/12 (40d6) Slightly changed TWOWIRE command format (sorreeee)
18/06/12 (40d0) Stavelet build (16T+H, 8I+H) with the SHT71 too - see opcode 0x80
13/06/12 (40c2) Stavelet build - 16 top + 8 IDC streams with histo - 
                this isn't meant for playing with the SHT71
13/06/12 (40c1) fixed SHT71 status reads (the $%^& chip doesn't work like the datasheet says!!!!!)
12/06/12 (40b8) added ocfifo full checking to rx_packet_decoder. 
                if full incoming packet will not be processed and an ack with oc=0xaaff will be sent.
                If full during processing rx will hang until it's clear, probably triggering a bark
11/06/12 (40b6) TWOWIRE: work progresses forwards and backwards. 40b4 worked, 40b5 not ...
 8/06/12 (40ad) TWOWIRE: improved fifo handling 
 8/06/12 (40ac) reverted to matts net_tx_pktfmt16 - bruces version has 2 CRCs
 7/06/12 (40ab) New SHT71 block, with possible i2c option
29/05/12 (40aa) added SHT71 control block - opcode 0x80 - much debug trialing
25/05/12 (40a5) Added pattern sending (see opcode 0x70), enabled in control_reg
24/05/12 (40a4) Added fifo levels read-back, more stream status words, stream busys, 
                pkt decoder respects size (ECHO is now correct!), reworked rx_packet_decoder_tb
17/05/12 (40a3) Debug outs rework - P4 moved to P5, P2,3,4 now unused. 
                Lemo 1,2,3 now show streams and link as selected by reg 21
16/05/12 (40a2) SM build - 32 top, 32 bot, 0 IDC, histos a not go.
16/05/12 (40a1) Stave build - 16 top, 8 IDC, histos a gogo. So far it seems good!
16/05/12 (40a0) ocrawcom_start set back to 12ns - messed up internals a bit
16/05/12 (409f) ocrawcom_start now syncd and stretched to 25ns
15/05/12 (409e) Seems to work, but ocrawcom_start has a glitch
15/05/12 (409d) Yeeeks - somehow lost dbg_oe. test build with just IDCs, no histos ...
14/05/12 (409c) Rebuild for SM - with 32 top, 32 bot, WITHOUT histo
14/05/12 (409b) Rebuild for Stave - with 16 top, 8 IDC streams, WITH histo

11/05/12 (4099) ANOTHER packet building bugfix in ro_deser
11/05/12 (4098) Another packet building bugfix in ro_deser
11/05/12 (4097) Robusterisation of case where trailers are very close to header 
                (aka while pkt header is being sent)
11/05/12 (4096) Bug in error packet sending another error packet and overflowing len fifo fixed
11/05/12 (4095) added len_fifo full checking (doh! to have missed it) 
                -hopefully we are completely ROBUST now
