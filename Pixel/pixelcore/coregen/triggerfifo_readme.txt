   regenerate a core.

triggerfifo_fifo_generator_v4_4_xst_1.ngc_xst.xrpt:
   Please see the core data sheet.

triggerfifo_flist.txt:
   Text file listing all of the output files produced when a customized
   core was generated in the CORE Generator.

triggerfifo_readme.txt:
   Text file indicating the files generated and how they are used.

triggerfifo_xmdf.tcl:
   ISE Project Navigator interface file. ISE uses this file to determine
   how the files output by CORE Generator for the core can be integrated
   into your ISE project.
